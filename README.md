# The Other Linux Logo

Hi Linux lovers, feel free to share, use and edit this Linux logo we have designed for you.

The good old Tux logo is really cool, we love and use it but a simple and efficient logo to identify Linux is missing. The Other Linux Logo is more icon-friendly and adapted to small sizes. It is also easy. Also, we want people to have the choice when it comes to picture the awesomeness of Linux!

[The Other Linux Logo](http://ecogex.com/the-other-linux-logo/) is under the [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/). It is made by [ECOGEX](http://ecogex.com/) with free software and love.
