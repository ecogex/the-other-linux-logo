# The Other Linux Logo

Hi Linux lovers, feel free to share, use and edit this Linux logo we have designed for you.

The good old Tux logo is really cool, we love and use it but a simple and efficient logo to identify Linux is missing. The Other Linux Logo is more icon-friendly and adapted to small sizes. It is also easy. Also, we want people to have the choice when it comes to picture the awesomeness of Linux!

To add an option to the demo, create a layer in the corresponding category or create your own category.
For exemple if you want to add another eyes option, create a new layer ‘beautiful eyes’ inside the eyes layer. If you want to add a hat, create a layer called ‘hats’ and then inside it create a layer with your design
